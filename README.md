## Overview
Streamlit is a powerful library for creating web applications directly from Python scripts. It allows data scientists and developers to build data-driven apps quickly with an intuitive API that automatically reflects changes.

## Installation/Setup
To get started with Streamlit, you need to install it using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

You can then run any `.py` file as a Streamlit app with:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Core Features
### st.write() and Magic
The `st.write()` function is the most versatile Streamlit function. It allows you to write anything, including text, markdown, data frames, and more. Magic commands simplify writing text by detecting plain strings.

### Streamlit Data Flow
Streamlit's data flow model follows a top-down approach, re-executing the script from top to bottom each time an interaction occurs, which maintains simplicity in state management.

### Text Elements
- `st.title()`, `st.header()`, and `st.subheader()` for titles.
- `st.markdown()` for markdown text.
- `st.caption()`, `st.text()`, and `st.code()` for captions, text, and code formatting.

### Images
To display images, use `st.image()`. It supports various formats and allows customization of width, captions, and more.

### Data Elements
Streamlit allows you to display data tables and arrays using `st.dataframe()` and `st.table()`.

### Chart Elements
Visualize data with built-in support for charts and plots using `st.line_chart()`, `st.bar_chart()`, and `st.map()`.

### Form Elements
Streamlit provides interactive widgets, including `st.button()`, `st.slider()`, `st.selectbox()`, and more.

## Examples
### Simple Form Example
```python
import streamlit as st

st.subheader("Simple Form Example")
with st.form(key='my_form'):
    name = st.text_input("Name")
    age = st.number_input("Age", min_value=1, max_value=100)
    submitted = st.form_submit_button("Submit")

    if submitted:
        st.write(f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.")
```

### Advanced Form Example
Advanced forms can include `st.checkbox()`, `st.radio()`, and other complex widgets, with results handled within callbacks.

## Session State
Streamlitâ€™s `st.session_state` allows you to store values across reruns and persist states like counters, form inputs, or toggled elements.

## Callbacks
Callbacks enable you to update specific elements in response to user interactions without rerunning the entire script.

## Layouts
Streamlit offers layout options using `st.sidebar` and `st.columns()` for arranging elements.

## Advanced Widget Concepts
### Caching
Use `@st.cache` to cache expensive operations for improved performance, such as loading data or models.

### st.rerun()
`st.rerun()` can be used to reload the script, useful in multi-step processes.

### Fragments
Fragments are reusable code blocks or components, useful in structuring larger applications.

## Multi-Page Apps
Streamlit enables multi-page applications with `st.experimental_multipage()`. Organize your app as a suite of pages.

## Advanced Pages
Explore ways to structure complex apps with reusable components, custom styling, and even plugins to enhance functionality.
